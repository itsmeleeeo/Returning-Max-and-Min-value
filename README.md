# Returning-Max-and-Min-value
Return Min and Max values from user input

Here is my first C# program. I am Web Developer and I have never used C# in my Dev life.
Right now, I am attending Computer Systems and Information at Douglas College (Vancouver, BC - Canada)
and our programming subject envolve C# as a language. Therefore, this is my first step on my learning curve using C#.
You can contact me through github or on my social medias for any hints to improve my learning curve and get more experience 
from well-experienced C# programmers. I appreciate your time reading my description and lets code!
